* Use PBKDF2ServiceProvider (see https://github.com/nrk/PBKDF2ServiceProvider).

* Since the website and API controllers can be mounted in subpaths, we should
  bind some routes such as the one to '/login' to specific route names and then
  make use of the UrlGeneratorProvider to handle internal redirects.

* Verify if we can abstract objects like user, news and comment to PHP classes
  that implement ArrayAccess (to maintain the current flexibility when adding,
  removing or simply accessing fields).
