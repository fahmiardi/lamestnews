* Rename Alpaca\DatabaseInterface to Alpaca\EngineInterface and rename the
  Alpaca\RedisDatabase class to Alpaca\Redis\Engine.

* Verify if we can abstract objects like user, news and comment to PHP classes
  that implement ArrayAccess (to maintain the current flexibility when adding,
  removing or simply accessing fields).

* Remove silex.phar from the repository and use git submodules, for development
  it is really the best way. For deployment we can just rely on Composer later.
