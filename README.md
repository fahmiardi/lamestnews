Lamer News (in PHP)
===================

This application is an almost direct port to PHP of [Salvatore Sanfilippo](http://antirez.com)'s
[Lamer News](http://github.com/antirez/lamernews) implemented using the [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.com)
microframework for the web part and [Predis](http://github.com/nrk/predis) for the Redis database.

While it tries to stick to the original Ruby implementation as much as possible (especially when it
comes with the layout of the data stored in Redis), some things may actually differ.

Right now it should not be considered more than an experiment.
